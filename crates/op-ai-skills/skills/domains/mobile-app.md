MOBILE APP — MANDATORY THREE-SECTION ARCHITECTURE:

Every mobile screen accounts for three logical layers: status chrome, app content,
and optional bottom navigation. These are architectural layers, not a requirement
to wrap every content section inside one padded App Content frame.

Screen-height contract: use numeric 390-393×844 as a temporary construction seed so an empty skeleton is visible. Before finishing, a normal content-driven mobile page switches its root to `height="fit_content"` (Hug), matching its completed flow. Keep a numeric viewport only when the user explicitly requested that viewport/device frame or the design deliberately contains one clipped viewport body that must consume remaining height.

## 1) STATUS BAR (OS-controlled) — PRE-INSERTED

The status bar (time, signal, wifi, battery) is **automatically pre-inserted** by the orchestrator as the first child of the root frame. It is a fixed 62px-tall frame with hardcoded path icons.

- **DO NOT generate a status bar** — it already exists
- **DO NOT delete or modify** the pre-inserted status bar
- **DO NOT give it a background fill** — it carries none, so it shows the screen behind it and its glyphs are already coloured for that background
- Your first section should start BELOW the status bar (it occupies ~62px)

## 2) APP CONTENT (your layout)

Chip rows (filter/date/guests pills): each chip HUGS (width fit_content, single-line text, height 36-44, cornerRadius=full); the ROW clips overflow (clipContent) instead of squeezing chips — never let a pill's text wrap. A badge/pill/button frame ALWAYS carries its content (text or icon) — an empty decorated frame renders as a mystery blob. Every tappable CTA/button/pill frame also carries cornerRadius (buttons 8-12, pills/chips full) — omitting it reads as an unstyled placeholder.

Keep the mobile root at 0 horizontal padding so status chrome, integrated bottom
navigation, and intentional full-bleed media can remain full width. Emit ordinary
app content as transparent root-direct section frames with
`width="fill_container"`, `height="fit_content"`, `layout="vertical"`, and the
same `padding: [0,24]` rail exactly once per section. Do not repeat that
horizontal inset on child wrappers. Only a deliberately clipped scroll viewport
under an explicit fixed-height root may use `height="fill_container"`; in that
case it is the ONE named remainder consumer, not a sizing mode copied onto its
sections.

Use gap and vertical padding, not margins or empty spacers, for rhythm between
sections. Give the last ordinary content section enough bottom padding to clear
the following bottom navigation.

A clipped horizontal scroller is the rail exception: its section stays full
width, its section header gets 24px left/right padding, and its clipped
viewport gets a 24px leading inset with a flush 0px trailing edge.

Content stacking order across the ordinary sections:

1. Top context: title / navigation header / search / filters
2. Primary content: the main "job to be done" for this screen
3. Supporting content: secondary modules, help text, empty states
4. Floating actions (optional): FAB or sticky CTA

Rules:

- One primary intent per screen. Everything else is subordinate.
- First 1-2 elements must answer "where am I" + "what can I do here"
- Mobile top rhythm: keep header/title close to the first useful control or content; use 20-32px, not an empty hero-sized band.
- Section header actions: prefer a 20px `chevron-right` / `arrow-right` icon, not visible "See all", "View all", "查看全部", or "查看更多" text.
- Category sections: section root and chip row both use height="fit_content". Use a header row, then chip row/grid. Chip row uses gap 12 and justifyContent start even when there are only two categories; never space_between/space_around. Each category item frame contains icon + label. Show four full chips or wrap; no half-clipped item.
- Product card rows: two equal `fill_container` cards, gap 12, inside the content rail; no fixed-width clipped second card.
- List rows of [thumbnail, text stack]: alignItems="center" on the row — a missing alignItems top-pins the text against a taller thumbnail and leaves a dead band under it.
- Corner badge on an image ("-35%", "NEW"): a CHILD of the image's wrapper frame with explicit x/y (e.g. x=8, y=8) — never a card-level sibling between the image and the content column (it renders straddling the seam).
- Price + unit ("$1,170" + "/ person", "$29" + "/mo"): ONE hugging row, gap 4-8, alignItems baseline/end — price 20-24px bold accent, unit 12-13px muted right beside it. Never space_between them across the card (the unit ends up orphaned at the far edge). Strikethrough original price: smaller muted line above or inline before the deal price.
- Header cart/notification controls are neutral icon buttons; counts are tiny circular badges, not square number blocks.
- Exact user mobile tokens win: "圆角 8px / 间距 12px" means ordinary radius=8 and repeated gaps=12.
- Title font size must be uniform across ALL screens in the app
- Design for one-handed use: primary actions in lower half
- When the screen is explicitly a fixed viewport, use at most one clipped content viewport; otherwise keep the content wrapper Hug Height. Avoid nested scrolls.
- Touch targets: minimum 44x44px
- Do not repeat the same predictable mobile stack of search + categories + orange promo + two cards. Choose a distinct concept for the domain and make one signature moment carry the personality.

DO NOT:

- Put the 24px content rail on the root page or duplicate it on an inner wrapper
- Let an ordinary root-direct content section touch the screen edge
- Use spacer elements for bottom space (use padding-bottom)
- Cram multiple competing sections above the fold

## 3) BOTTOM TAB BAR — OPTIONAL, INTEGRATED

Do not force bottom navigation into every mobile screen. Use a bottom tab bar only when the product clearly has persistent top-level destinations (Home, Search, Orders, Profile, etc.). If the screen is a single-task flow, omit bottom navigation. 3-5 tabs, top-level destinations only. Make it the LAST child in the screen's vertical stack — never absolutely positioned.

Pick ONE of two idioms and commit:

IDIOM A — INTEGRATED BAR (Android / utility / data-dense apps):

- Full screen width, part of the page flow, role="bottom-tab-bar"
- Height 62-72px; background = same page palette or a subtle tonal surface
- Separation: quiet 1px divider or tonal contrast only; no detached shadow band
- Not a floating pill, not a nested rounded capsule, not a separate footer band; direct tab item frames stay transparent (no fill / stroke / rounded tile)

IDIOM B — FLOATING CAPSULE (iOS-native / premium / consumer apps):

- A capsule that floats inset from the edges: ~16px sides, ~12px above the bottom — never flush. Give the screen stack ~12px bottom padding so the capsule clears the edge.
- ~56px tall, cornerRadius = half the height (true capsule ends), ~6px inner padding
- Frosted look: tonal surface fill at ~70% opacity + one soft shadow (the only shadowed element on the screen)
- Selected item sits on a soft accent-tinted capsule highlight; inactive items are transparent

Tab Items (both idioms):

- Width / height fill_container; layout vertical, gap 4, centered both axes
- Icon ~18-22px above a label (10-11px, weight 500-600, sentence case, letterSpacing 0)
- Selected: accent icon+label, FILLED icon variant. Inactive: muted neutral, OUTLINE icon variant. The fill/outline swap is the primary state signal, not color alone.

Rules: tab switching preserves each tab's state; app content must never be obscured by the bar.

## BLUEPRINT (internal planning)

Before generating nodes, mentally verify these three layers are accounted for:

1. Status Bar: standard or edge-to-edge?
2. App Content: what is the header, primary content, action placement, scroll behavior?
3. Bottom Bar: None, integrated bar, or floating capsule (which idiom, which tabs)?

Do NOT output this blueprint as text. Apply it silently through your node structure.
Your output must remain valid JSON/JSONL only.
