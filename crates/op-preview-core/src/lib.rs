//! Canvas Preview (Play) mode — runtime owner (Phase D5).
//!
//! When the editor enters Preview mode, the current document is run
//! through the jian `Runtime` so widget nodes become live + interactive
//! (typing into inputs, toggling switches, caret blink, focus chain).
//! The runtime is built from the document's serialized form, so the
//! saved `PenDocument` is NEVER mutated: enter clones via JSON, exit
//! drops the runtime, and the editor's `doc` is byte-identical.
//!
//! ## Why this lives host-side, not in `op-editor-core`
//!
//! `jian_core::Runtime` holds `Rc<...>` (scheduler / state graph), so it
//! is `!Send`. `op-editor-core` must stay wasm32-clean + does not hold
//! the runtime. The session therefore lives on the native host
//! (`WidgetHostNative`), which is already UI-thread-local (it owns skia
//! handles). The editor state only carries the `preview.mode` flag +
//! warning list (`EditorUiState::{enter,exit}_preview`).
//!
//! ## Render — reuse the design-canvas renderer
//!
//! Preview does NOT paint through jian's `collect_draws_with_widgets`
//! MVP scene walker (which scatters multi-root docs to the origin,
//! greys out every image, and re-implements text metrics). Instead it
//! renders the live document through the SAME mature painter the design
//! canvas uses: the host hands in the design `LayoutScene`, we overlay
//! each interactive widget's LIVE runtime value (typed text / toggle /
//! slider / select) onto the scene's `SceneWidget`s, and paint it with
//! [`op_editor_ui::widgets::paint_scene_page`] — pixel-identical to the
//! design surface (root offsets, images, gradients, shadows, real glyph
//! metrics), plus a focus caret drawn on top. The editor's normal
//! selection / handles / grid do NOT paint in preview.
//!
//! Binding overlay limits (Spec-2 slice): only `content` bindings are
//! re-resolved; the scene is NOT re-laid-out, so text that grows past
//! its authored box paints per the design painter's normal overflow
//! behavior. `visible` / fill / geometry bindings are collected but not
//! yet applied.
//!
//! ## Hit-testing across two coordinate spaces
//!
//! The scene paints DESIGN-canvas geometry while the runtime hit-tests
//! its own (promoted, re-solved) layout, so a tap arriving in SCENE
//! space maps through the rect pair of the deepest painted node it hit,
//! with a per-gesture anchor (pointer capture). The whole pipeline
//! lives in `input.rs` — see its module docs.
//!
//! ## Module split
//!
//! To honor the 800-line-per-file cap, [`PreviewSession`] is a spine in
//! `session.rs` (struct + retained fields + `enter` + accessors) with
//! the scene overlay/paint impls in the sibling `session_paint.rs`;
//! [`AppMode`] + the per-root `solve_roots` + the app-mode query methods
//! live in `app_mode.rs`, keyboard/focus/pointer dispatch + the
//! scene→runtime coordinate mapping live in `input.rs`, and the leaf
//! formatter helpers (`apply_widget_state` / `display_string` /
//! `format_warning`) live in `scene_helpers.rs`. The crate root keeps
//! only module declarations and stable re-exports.
